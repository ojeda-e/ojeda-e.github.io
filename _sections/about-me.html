<p align="justify"><strong>Estefania Barreto-Ojeda</strong> was born in Bogot√°, Colombia, where she obtained her B.Sc.
in Physics at Universidad Nacional de Colombia. After finishing her M.Sc. degree
at Instituto Balseiro, in Bariloche, Argentina (yes, it is in Patagonia!),
crossed the continent up to Calgary to pursue a Ph.D. in Biophysical Chemistry.
<br><br>
Estefania's research interests mix computational tools and statistical analysis
to study biological systems with medical and pharmaceutical relevance. One of
the main goals of her research is trying to better understand the physics behind
the properties of biological membranes. During her Ph.D. Estefania TA courses
involving scientific writing and statistical analysis.
<br><br>
Estefania is also a data visualization fan and machine learning enthusiast. In
2020, she offered the first ML grad course for biologists at The University of
Calgary. In the summer of 2021, Estefania is part of the <strong><a
href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code</a></strong> 
program with <strong><a
href="https://www.mdanalysis.org">MDAnalyisis</a></strong> in 2021. Her
contribution to open source came with the <strong><a
    href="https://github.com/MDAnalysis/membrane-curvature">MembraneCurvature</a></strong>  tool to derive curvature profiles
from MD simulations. Because she wants to make of the world a
better place, she's happy to share the code. In the same year, Estefania participated in the <strong><a
href="/portfolio/data-science/cybera-fellowship/">Cybera Data Science
Fellowship</a></strong>
where she developed an automated approach to optimize young student-athletes'
carrer paths interested in a profesional carreer in hockey.
<br><br>
Currently, Estefania is TAing a Data Visualization in Python course for the
certificate in Data Science at the University of Calgary.
<br><br>
In her free time, she improves her sushi-making and baking skills while waiting
for the pandemic to be over and travel around the world.
<br><br>
You can find her leaning towards the left.
