<p align="justify">
I was born in Bogot√°, Colombia, where I earned my B.Sc. in Physics from Universidad Nacional de Colombia. 
After completing my M.Sc. in Physics at Instituto Balseiro in Argentina,
I made my way north to Canada to pursue a Ph.D. in Biophysical Chemistry at the University of Calgary.
<br><br>
My research interests lie at the intersection of cutting-edge computational tools,
statistical analysis, and Machine Learning (ML) applied to biological systems with medical and
pharmaceutical relevance.
I am passionate about automation and performance optimization in complex computational workflows,
especially in the context of drug discovery. I love working with Astral products, specially with <code>uv</code> for managing my Python
environments (looking at you <code>torch</code> dependencies! üåù). I also like to use FastAPI for building
scalable and fast ML inference services. üöÄ
<br><br>
In industry, I have worked as an ML Engineer at <a href="https://www.recursion.com/">Recursion Pharmaceuticals</a>,
where I designed and maintained scalable ML pipelines for drug discovery. I led the implementation of
key tools and infrastructure to support ML workflows, from automating training pipelines,
to benchmarking GPUs on large HPC clusters, to setting up data version control for curated datasets.
I also worked as a computational scientist at Cyclica Inc. (later acquired by Recursion), where I developed
the company's first ML inference solution to serve internal models with minimal latency.

Since I'm a big believer in best engineering and documentation practices, I pioneered automated documentation solutions
for Recursion‚Äôs Model Catalogue of chemical property prediction models, introduced API docs for internal tools (using Sphinx!), 
and implemented unit and integration tests across all ML repositories to improve reliability and maintainability.
<br><br>
Outside of work, I'm a data visualization enthusiast and open-source advocate.
When I'm not coding or exploring new tech, you can find me cooking, camping,
road-tripping through the Canadian Rockies, or enjoying long bike rides.
I'm also improving my sushi-making and baking skills, just in case another pandemic strikes.

You can find me leaning towards the left.
