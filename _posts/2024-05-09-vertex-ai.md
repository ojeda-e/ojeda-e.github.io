If youâ€™ve spent any time deploying ML systems in production, you know that managed platforms can be a blessing and a curse. At Recursion, I started working with [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai), Google Cloudâ€™s fully managed AI platform. It promises to take care of the infrastructure so you can focus on models and data. Sounds good, right?

It mostly is. Until itâ€™s not.

This isnâ€™t a teardown post. I actually like a lot of what Vertex AI offers: out-of-the-box pipelines, flexible deployment options, decent integration with the rest of GCP. But once you move beyond tutorials and toy datasets, the platformâ€™s limits start showing up fast.

The deeper I went, the more friction I hit.

Instead of a single massive post listing every issue I ran into, Iâ€™m breaking this into focused chunks, each tackling a specific area where Vertex AI falls short for real-world use.

ðŸ”– In this series:
1. [Limitations â€“ Online Predictions](/blog/vertex-ai-limitations-online/) <br>
    What happens when your deployed model doesnâ€™t respond? How much control do you actually have over the prediction server? (Spoiler: not much.)
1. [Limitations â€“ Batch Predictions](/blog/vertex-ai-limitations-batch/) <br>
    Scaling batch jobs should be easy. But good luck if you need custom logic, retries, or visibility into what actually ran.
1. [Limitations â€“ Model Registry Predictions](/blog/vertex-ai-limitations-model-registry/) <br>
    Model versioning is essential for any ML workflow. Vertex AI has a registry, but itâ€™s missing critical features for traceability and reproducibility.

Each post includes real-world errors, workarounds, and the kind of surprises you only discover after youâ€™ve sunk hours into debugging.
