				<h2>The project</h2>
				<p>22 June 2021</p>
			</header><p>A brief introduction to my GSoC project!</p>

<hr />

<p>It’s been two weeks since I started my Google Summer of Code (<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">GSoC</a>) journey and
before moving forward, I would like to take a moment to share details of <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5098282306502656">my_project</a>, 
the motivations behind it, as well as my expectations. The main goal is
to integrate a membrane curvature analysis tool into <a href="https://github.com/MDAnalysis">MDAnalysis</a>. This tool will
enable users to calculate the membrane curvature, in terms of mean and Gaussian
curvature, of biological membranes.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/PM_Membrane_EBO.png" alt="membrane" width="1000" /></p>

<p>Fundamentally, biological membranes are functional and structural assemblies
composed of a lipid bilayer matrix and associated proteins. Despite this
simplification, biological membranes are diverse and highly complex. Their lipid
composition varies according to their physical properties and functional roles.
Additionally, their asymmetrical lipid composition by leaflet also contributes
to maintaining specific mechanisms. Hence, biological membranes are not a pure
architecture trick played by the cell. Instead, they actively drive many
processes involving membrane remodeling and membrane trafficking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How does <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">membrane_curvature</code> work? (A glimpse)</li>
</ul>

<p>To calculate membrane curvature, we first need a surface. Given the nature of
biological membranes, we can use phospholipids -core elements of lipid
bilayers-, as elements of reference to derive the surfaces associated with each
leaflet. For simplicity, we can use the lipid head groups to define the surface.
Once we think of leaflets as surfaces defined by lipid headgroups, we can
calculate the mean and Gaussian curvature.</p>

<p>Mean curvature is an extrinsic property of a surface. Gaussian curvature, on the
other hand, is intrinsic. That is to say, mean curvature depends on the
coordinate space in which the surface is embedded, while the Gaussian curvature
can be calculated within the surface itself without any reference to a larger
space. Mean and Gaussian curvature together give information about how curved
and how elastic the membrane is. In the figure below, given an arbitrary surface
(left panel), the corresponding plots of mean (middle) and Gaussian curvature
(right panel) are shown.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What will this project unlock? What will the membrane curvature tool enable?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are in the MD simulations field and you work with any protein-membrane or
membrane-only system, this tool will help your research work! Findings reported
in literature suggest that there is an interplay between membrane curvature and
protein sorting [<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.0c00419">1</a>] [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms9728">2</a>] [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D0SM01573C">3</a>] and/or protein function [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.114454">4</a>][<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50576">5</a>]. Although
this complex interaction may be determined by the specific features of the
membrane (lipid type, lipid composition) or the protein (protein shape, type of
residues facing the membrane, protein conformation), curvature of biological
membranes can provide valuable insight when addressing a research problem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When and where will I find the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">membrane_curvature</code> tool?</li>
</ul>

<p>The membrane curvature tool is expected to be part of the <a href="https://github.com/MDAnalysis">MDAnalysis</a>
analysis package in future versions. A sample of how it is
expected to work in the future looks like this</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import MDAnalysis as mda
from MDAnalysis.analysis.curvature import Curvature

atom_file = &lt;your coordinates file from MD simulations&gt;
traj_file = &lt;your trajectory from MD simulations&gt;

u = mda.Universe(atom_file, traj_file)

surface = u.select_atoms("&lt;atoms of reference&gt;")

curvature = Curvature(surface).run()

mean = curvature.mean_curvature()
gaussian = curvature.gaussian_curvature()
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>What are the limitations to calculate membrane curvature?</li>
</ul>

<p>When calculating membrane curvature in MD simulations, there are two main
limitations.</p>

<p>The first one is sampling. To properly sample a decent range of curvatures in
MD, the required simulation times are very large, reaching dozens or hundreds of
microseconds. Such time scales are expensive and sometimes only affordable by
state-of-the-art research groups.</p>

<p>The second limitation is the lack of user-friendly, actively-maintained and
well-documented tools to analyze membrane curvature. Although some GitHub repos
exist, not all of them are maintained and/or documented, some lack source code,
benchmarks are non-existent, or they have not been ported to the modern Python 3
environment.</p>

<p>This was, in fact, one of my strongest motivations to contribute a membrane
curvature tool under the <a href="https://github.com/MDAnalysis">MDAnalysis</a> umbrella. With <a href="https://github.com/MDAnalysis/membrane-curvature">membrane_curvature</a>,
students and researchers will be able to calculate mean and gaussian curvature
of biological membranes using one of the most popular, easy-to-use, and
actively-maintained packages for analysis of MD simulations.</p>

<p>I started developing this tool as part of my Ph.D. and I would like to share it
with the wider MD community. I am convinced that by sharing our knowledge and
open-sourcing our algorithms and tools, science will move forward at a faster
pace.</p>

<p>Share the code and help the world!</p>

<p>And while you are here, did you know that MDAnalysis is one of the most popular
Python libraries to analyze MD simulations? MDAnalysis core developers actively
work to make it better with every release.
