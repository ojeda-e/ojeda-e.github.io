### Technologies
- Docker
- Agile Frameworks
- Numpy / Pandas / Scikit-Learn / Jupyter
- Json API scrapping.

### Summary
The goal of this project was to build a recommender system to optimize career
paths for students athletes interested in pursuing a professional career in
hockey. I build a [Markov Decission Process
(MDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process) using historical
data from the [EliteProspects] API to calculate the transition probability
between hockey leagues. This model works as a recommender system that helps
student athletes to choose optimal career paths in hockey based on athletic
training, academic paths, and financial measurables.

### What did I do?
- Developed an automated data extraction library for capturing, cleaning, and archiving 250,000 records from upstream API.
- Researched and built a reinforcement learning ML model from scratch using Markov Decision Processes. 
- Provided data visualization solutions to enable communication between technical team and industry partners.
