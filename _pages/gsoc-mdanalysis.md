### Summary
Open-source Python development to calculate and visualize 2D and 3D curvature profiles of biological membranes. 

### What did I do?
- Developed [algorithm] to calculate membrane curvature from MD simulations.
- Built automated pipeline with 100% code coverage.
- Applied software engineering best practices to write clean and modular code. 
- Wrote [tutorials] and technical [documentation].
