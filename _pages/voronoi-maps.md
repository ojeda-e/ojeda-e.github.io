### Technologies
- SciPy / Pandas / Smopy / Jupyter
- Matplotlib / Polycollection
- API data access 

### Summary
I calculated Voroni diagrams using the location of public libraries
in the City of Calgary. To find the closest library for a given location in the city, I used OpenStreetMaps overlapped by Voronoi tesellation maps. All data was extracted from the City of Calgary’s [Open Data Catalogue](https://data.calgary.ca/), an open data portal.  

### What did I do?
- Data mining using Python packages to analyze databases.
- Developed Voronoi-map-based algorithm to analyze data from The City of Calgary’s Open Data Portal.
