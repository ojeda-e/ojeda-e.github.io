### Summary
Built a comprehensive fitness tracking dashboard using Looker Studio integrated with Google Cloud SQL to visualize workout progress and patterns, and performance metrics. The dashboard enables data-driven decision-making for fine-tuning training routines and optimizing workout effectiveness. By connecting real-time workout data to interactive visualizations, the project demonstrates how personal data can be transformed into actionable insights for health and personal fitness goals.

### What did I do?
- Designed and implemented a Cloud SQL database schema to store workout data including exercises, sets, reps, weights, and training sessions.
- Integrated Looker Studio with Cloud SQL to create real-time data connections and automated data refresh pipelines.
- Built interactive dashboards with multiple chart types including time series, bar charts, and trend analysis to track progress over time.
- Created visualizations that help identify patterns in training performance and guide data-informed discussions with fitness trainers.
- Established a data pipeline that transforms raw workout logs into meaningful metrics for progress tracking.
